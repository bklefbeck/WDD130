    <h2>Bailey</h2>
    <h2>Bailes</h2>
    <p>I am a CIT major and i am a big fan of all nerd stuff, such as comic books, sci fi, video games, all that. I am a fan of hockey and baseball, formula one as well.
        I am hoping that my degree will take me towards tech support in some kind.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the pacific northwest and have always loved the tradition our family has of going camping to MT. Rainier every summer, 
        we always have a fun time and enjoy nature out there in the national park.</p>
